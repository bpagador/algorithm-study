Challenge from Chris Ling

Sr. Engineer: So, as you know, our product is an image processor that can read the suits and values off a deck of playing cards.

Unfortunately, the output of the processor are two arrays, one of suits and one of values, in the order they were processed.

Sr. Engineer: We want you to make a function that will merge these arrays into a single data structure. 

The structure should be able to access a specific card--e.g. ‘the third card’--and access the specific card’s properties--e.g. ‘the third card’s suit,’--in an engineering-friendly way.

Sr. Engineer: Oh! We also want to have the option of sorting the cards in one of four ways:

(1) by value;
(2) by suit;
(3) by value, then suit; and
(4) by suit, then value.

And of course, we want an option to keep it unsorted.

Sr. Engineer: Another thing! I want you to present me two versions in two different languages. You can choose the two languages, but they have to be… generally similar. So like if you pick Java for one, you can’t pick Ruby for the other. Oh, and you can’t use any built-in sorting functions for the languages you chose!

Sr. Engineer: Oh, and I don’t necessarily need the fastest option, but I’d like for you to be able to discuss with me the pros and cons of any sorting approach you took, and be able to discuss some of the differences between the two languages you used, specific to this ticket. Thanks!

Sr. Engineer: If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. I can only respond once a day, so think about what you want to ask. When you have a solution, send me a link on repl.it to stage your code!
